Here is a Pytorch implementation of the Reinforcement Learning Algorithms.

## Warning:
* I have just changed part of the codes so that there exists a high probability that you will run into errors when running my code. I am not sure when I will fix it since I may be busy taking midterm exams recently. (ps. the ppo_adapted_agent is fine)

## Basic Agents

* [Deep Q Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)

* [Double Deep Q Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)

* [Deep Q Learning with the Priorized Replay Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)

* [Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783)

* [Trust Region Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477)

* [Proximal Policy Optimization (with the Clipped Surrogate Loss)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)

* [Proximal Policy Optimization (with the Adapted Surrogate Loss)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)
